# CodeKata

## Install

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

`python codekata {challenge_number} {day}`

## Challenge One

Challenge one is not an actual "coding" code kata, instead it is a mental
exercise. I might eventually do a write-up of my thoughts on that challenge,
but for the time being the `one.py` module is merely boilerplate for the
other days, allowing me to do `cp one.py two.py`.

## Challenge Two

### Day One

There is a pretty simple and basic implementation. I didn't encounter any
issues other than I got the `>` mixed up for the `m = e` branch of the if
statement. Fixed that and then it ran just fine. Little concerned that I won't
have four more ways to write this!
