# CodeKata

## Install

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

`python codekata {challenge_number} {day}`

## A Note

Challenge one is not an actual "coding" code kata, instead it is a mental
exercise. I might eventually do a write-up of my thoughts on that challenge,
but for the time being the `one.py` module is merely boilerplate for the
other days, allowing me to do `cp one.py two.py`.
