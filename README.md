# codekata

[CodeKata](http://codekata.com/) is a blog with a series of Katas for
programmers. Each post, with the exception of the post offers a problem to
solve in the language of the developer's choice. The challenge is to spend
approximate 30 minutes a day on the challenge. Each Kata is to be solved five
times -- once per day for five days. On day six you move onto the next Kata.

My solutions will initially be in Python only, and located under the /python
directory. Subsequent solutions in other languages will be under a directory
named for the language. Language specific instructions will be located in the
README.md at the root of the language's directory. Generally, I will strive to
provide a framework for each language and use some form of testing to assert
"rightness".
